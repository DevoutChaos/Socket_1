You can read all of the defines and includes for yourself within the source file.

This file uses 2 functions, 'main' and 'doTheDoThing'

doTheDoThing is called inside main, and is used as it contains a loop which is used
many times throughout the code. It takes int sock as an argument, declaring count and buf[2048] 
inside it. count what we use for sending and receiving data, and buf (buffer) is the
actual readable information.
The loop goes through anything which has been received and outputs it using cout.

Inside main, the declarations can be seen within the source code, under headings which
show what they will be used for.
We then procede to set-up our first socket with error handling. We follow the diagram
given in the assignment so that we know what we need to send the server and in what order.
After we have declared PASV (passive) for the first time, we read from the server twice,
confirming we entered passiv, and getting the port number.
We parse this port number and convert it into a usable form, creating a second socket
using this new port. This done, we request the list, listening with socket 2.
We then close the second socket, and go back to passive and do it all again (from passive)
except retrieving a file instead of listing all of them.
Once we have the file, we close the second socket, and then QUIT.
At he end there is a cin.get() which waits for user input, just to make sure that the
screen doesn't disappear before we can check it has completed successfully.
